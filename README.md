# Personal Portfolio Site
Personal portfolio site to highlight my development work and experience. 

#### Live site here:

## Purpose:
Purpose of this application is to revamp my old portfolio site. My previous portfolio site was built back in 2020 when I first began learning how to code. It was built using a Bootstrap template and while it looked good on the surface, the code behind it was horrific. 

I've recently been learning React.js and Tailwind CSS and thought it would be a good opportunity to rebuild my portfolio site. Site is fully responsive, designed with a mobile-first approach. 
 
## Technologies Used:
  - React.js
  - Tailwind CSS for design/styling
  - Netlify/Github for hosting and CI/CD
